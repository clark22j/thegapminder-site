  <h1>TheGapMinder‚Ñ¢</h1>
  <p><strong>Welcome!</strong> This site is a companion to the TuneMinder‚Ñ¢ app and other tools designed to help you manage creative knowledge and close the gap between where you are and where you want to be.</p>

  <p> 
      TheGapMinder is a hobbyist playground for Apps intended to nudge humanity toward an abundant future, where learning new skills and finding meaningful ways to contribute to the world becomes a priority for us all.  Ok, a grand vision, but why not?   In truth, not expecting to go viral here, so most of the apps you‚Äôll find (ok, just one at present) are apps developed over the past few months for a little ‚Äúvibe-coding‚Äù experiment (see below).  Of course, TheGapMinder community (such as it is), welcomes any and all contributions that move us collectively in that direction, contact TheGapMinder below if you‚Äôd like to join the cause. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Yes, TheGapMinder is an evolving experiment, originally intended to see if there‚Äôs any way an aging, un-trained (ok, some training, long, long ago) hobbyist can create smartphone apps, and avoid generating pure ‚ÄúAI Slop‚Äù, with modern LLMs - starting, in mid 2025, with ChatGPT.  Hopefully the experiment will evolve from there.  The app on this site was virtually entirely written by ChatGPT, and is offered, for free, as a gesture of encouragement toward a world of useful AI collaboration.   Most of the UI artifacts and structure were suggested by ChatGPT in one conversation or another, and, not knowing any better, I mostly went along, so my personal creativity was not the driving force behind very much of it, though I certainly had an input in the conversations. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So, slop?  I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs plenty.  ChatGPT doesn‚Äôt use Apps, how can it know what frustrates us humans?  Trust me, it doesn‚Äôt.  While much time was spent coaching it on those things, I don‚Äôt get to take much credit for the app design, and I get to deflect the blame for its shortcomings, what could be better for a newbie hobbyist?  Well, you get the idea of the experiment - learning to love AI, I think, is the first step on this new journey. 
  </p>
    
  <p>
     The first App, TuneMinder, is a resource for helping musicians through their musical journey, from just starting out, to coordinating live performances.  Of course, I wanted it to be useful for me, which it is, after some effort and coaxing.  I now use it often, most every day, in a wide variety of contexts, and it really seems to be helping, and that‚Äôs good enough for me.  But I recognize that my musical needs may not be reflective of the broader musical community, and, as a hobbyist, I enjoy taking suggestions and feedback as a challenge, to see what more we can get out of these new AI companions.  The plan is to open source the entire code base (once ChatGPT cleans it up a bit), so anyone interested can directly contribute, if so desired.  So, you are invited to give it a try, provide feedback, and let me know what you‚Äôd like the AI to tackle next.  It‚Äôs one way to join the experiment, and help shape the AI future in a positive direction‚Ä¶:)

    <p>
      <strong>TuneMinder‚Ñ¢</strong> keeps a record of all the tunes you know or are working on, along with key information to keep you on top of the tune, including the basics like Genre and Key, as well as details like melody lines, chord patterns, lyrics, and even sheet music for traditional tunes (from TheSession.org), and much more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Practice tunes by playing along with your favorite recordings, while also recording what you play to get instant feedback. Keep track of set lists for gigs and practice sessions. Share tunes and setlists with others. Create playlists of the tunes you love or are learning.
    </p>

    <p>
      Get quick access to tutorials and play the tune right from the app to optimize your practice time. Use TuneMinder when playing with others for quick reminders of melodies and sets to keep the sessions going smoothly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Built-in recording capabilities let you hear your progress and focus on areas for improvement. TuneMinder is the perfect tool for learning all kinds of music‚Äîfrom Celtic session favorites to Bluegrass jams, to HipHop and Jazz. Any time you want to share music with others (which I hope is often), TuneMinder is your trusted resource.
    </p>
