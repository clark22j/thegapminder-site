  <p><strong>Welcome!</strong> This site is a companion to the TuneMinder app and other tools designed to help you manage creative knowledge and close the gap between where you are and where you want to be.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>TuneMinder</strong> keeps a record of all the tunes you know or are working on, along with key information to keep you on top of the tune, including the basics like Genre and Key, as well as details like melody lines, chord patterns, lyrics, and even sheet music for traditional tunes (from TheSession.org), and much more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Practice tunes by playing along with your favorite recordings, while also recording what you play to get instant feedback. Keep track of set lists for gigs and practice sessions. Share tunes and setlists with others. Create playlists of the tunes you love or are learning.
    </p>

    <p>
      Get quick access to tutorials and play the tune right from the app to optimize your practice time. Use TuneMinder when playing with others for quick reminders of melodies and sets to keep the sessions going smoothly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Built-in recording capabilities let you hear your progress and focus on areas for improvement. TuneMinder is the perfect tool for learning all kinds of musicâ€”from Celtic session favorites to Bluegrass jams, to HipHop and Jazz. Any time you want to share music with others (which I hope is often), TuneMinder is your trusted resource.
