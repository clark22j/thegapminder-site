  <p><strong>Welcome!</strong> This site is a companion to the TuneMinder‚Ñ¢ app and other tools designed to help you manage creative knowledge and close the gap between where you are and where you want to be.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>TuneMinder‚Ñ¢</strong> keeps a record of all the tunes you know or are working on, along with key information to keep you on top of the tune, including the basics like Genre and Key, as well as details like melody lines, chord patterns, lyrics, sheet music, and much more (for traditional tunes, the full TheSession.org database is included, with access to a vast collection of Celtic and traditional tunes).
    </p>

    <p>
      Practice tunes by playing along with your favorite recordings, while also recording what you play to get instant feedback. Keep track of set lists for gigs and practice sessions. Share tunes and setlists with others. Create playlists of the tunes you love or are learning.
    </p>

    <p>
      Get quick access to tutorials and play the tune right from the app either on YouTube, or with Apple Music, to optimize your practice time. Use TuneMinder when playing with others for quick reminders of melodies and sets to keep sessions going smoothly.
    </p>

    <p>
      TuneMinder is the perfect tool for learning and sharing all kinds of music‚Äîfrom Celtic session favorites to Bluegrass jams, to HipHop and Jazz. Any time you want to share music with others (which I hope is often), TuneMinder is your trusted resource.

      <strong>More about TheGapMinder</strong>strong>  
  </p>  
        
  <p>     
    TheGapMinder is a home for Apps intended to nudge humanity toward an abundant future, where learning new skills and finding meaningful ways to contribute to the world becomes a priority, for all of us.  It's a lofty vision, but that is what‚Äôs needed in these days of unprecedented change, where the emergence of AI brings us to a fork in the road - dystopia or utopia, our choice.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first App here is intended to smooth the path to learning and sharing music with the world - one  of the most meaningful avenues out there.   More Apps will follow exploring other domains - the opportunity space is enormous.   Cooking, Fitness, all manner of hobbies and professions, all have unique needs that have so far struggled to find tools that are really fit for purpose in the real world.  Shockingly, it seems that the really devoted contributors to most domains are not software developers.  But now they can be, with a little AI help, and TheGapMinder community (such as it is), welcomes any and all contributions that move us collectively in that direction, contact us below if you‚Äôd like to join the cause.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    TheGapMinder started as an experiment in ‚Äúvibe-coding‚Äù, to see if it‚Äôs possible for a complete newcomer to the world of App development to create something useful, and avoid generating pure ‚ÄúAI Slop‚Äù, using modern LLMs - starting, in mid 2025, with ChatGPT.   The first app on this site was virtually entirely written by ChatGPT, through a collaborative process of iterative prompting, which was quite a journey, but also very fun and engaging from start to finish.  Lots of lessons were learned along the way, and my hope is to share some of those lessons with others interested in seeing what‚Äôs possible with AI. 
  </p>
    
  <p>
     The first step on TheGapMinder journey is what I call the ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù test, that is, ‚Äúwhy hasn‚Äôt this been solved yet?‚Äù    Find something that frustrates you when you‚Äôre doing what you love.  For me, having chosen music as a hobby in retirement, I found myself juggling hundreds of songs, each with complex structures, lyrics, and spanning multiple genres, and I really struggled to keep everything I needed for learning, practicing, performing and just jamming with friends around the campfire, in one place that was always accessible, even when ‚Äúoff grid‚Äù.   So I had to ask ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt there an app for this?‚Äù    Well, now there is - in just a few weeks TuneMinder was born. 
  </p>

   <p>
    One asperational goal for TheGapMinder is to create ‚ÄúThe Why Prize‚Äù (a not-so-subtle nod to Peter D‚Äôs X-Prize), to recognize contributions that make life more fun, and more meaningful for everyone (I need to get that Patreon thing going first‚Ä¶:) 
  </p>
  
   <p>
     Is it AI slop?  Partly, sure - ChatGPT doesn‚Äôt use Apps, how can it know what frustrates us humans? Trust me, it doesn‚Äôt.  While much time was spent coaching it on those things, I don‚Äôt get to take much credit for the app design, and I get to deflect the blame for its shortcomings, what could be better for a newbie hobbyist?   So, you get the idea of the experiment - learning to love AI, I think, is the first step on this new journey.  The acid test though, is whether the App is actually useful for me, which it is.  I now use it often, most every day, in a wide variety of contexts, and it really seems to be helping, and that‚Äôs good enough for me.  It‚Äôs certainly a massive improvement over what I was doing before, so I can put up with a little slop, if that‚Äôs the price of AI inspired utility.  
   </p>

   <p>
    Of course I recognize that my musical needs may not be reflective of the broader musical community, and, as a hobbyist, I enjoy taking suggestions and feedback as a challenge, to see what more we can get out of these new AI companions.  The plan is to open source the entire code base (once ChatGPT cleans it up a bit), so anyone interested can directly contribute.  So, you are invited to give TuneMinder a try, provide feedback, and let me know what you‚Äôd like the AI to tackle next.  It‚Äôs one way to join the experiment, and help shape our AI future in a positive direction‚Ä¶:)
